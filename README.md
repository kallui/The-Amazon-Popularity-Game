# Amazon Popularity Game

## Overview

This repository captures the project developed during the nwHacks 2022 hackathon â€“ the Amazon Popularity Game. The game, created by a team of four, engages users by presenting two random Amazon items each round and prompting them to guess which item is more popular. Drawing inspiration from the web-based game "Higher Lower Game," this project combines HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to deliver an interactive and entertaining experience.
